# Projects
Hello! My name is Casey Ye, a current freshman at the Cooper Union! This is a repository of all the projects I've worked on so far.

## Featured Projects: 
For the following projects, I would like to give special thanks to my brilliant mentor, Ridwan Hussain. I would not be making PCBs in my freshman year if it weren't for his support and guidance. ❤️

- <ins>Holiday Tree</ins>: My very first PCB! It's holiday tree-shaped PCB that lights up. 
- <ins>Theremin Pitch Control</ins>: A PCB version of the theremin pitch control circuit done in sophomore projects.
- <ins>PCB Ruler</ins>: A Cooper Union-themed PCB Ruler.
