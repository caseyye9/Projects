# Holiday Tree

This was the first ever PCB I've ever worked on. The holiday tree PCB was a project that was used during the 'PCB Lab' workshop, intended to introduce students to PCB design. As an operator, I made my own version of the board before helping out with the workshop. 

This tree utilizes a 555 timer and a 2-Bit Counter to switch between sets of red, green, blue, and yellow LEDs to light up a holiday tree-shaped PCB.
